## About

* This Project is about to create a CMS using Laravel and admin LTE Template.

* Check the laravelcms.sql in order to get into the database architecture of this system.

* There's an allowance feature to access the dashboard panel.
* Only admin users are allowed to create, edit and delete another users.

## Getting Started

* Check the web file to get into the routes, which is located at: routes>web.php
* To be able to do a CRUD, I'm using a --resource feature to make it quicker.
* I'm using the validation file (resources>lang>en>validation.php) to display a standard message depending on the language which was set to default.
